# Xolt Language Concept

## Warning

>[!WARNING]
>This document is a concept and may be subject to change. The projected dates and development complexity may change. Do not expect a quick and exact implementation.

## Overview

**Xolt** is a modern programming language designed to be simple and intuitive. Developed by a single person, Xolt aims to provide a versatile language for a wide range of applications.

### Key Features

- **Simplicity**: Xolt is designed to be simple and intuitive.
- **Power**: Despite its simplicity, Xolt has powerful features.
- **Open Source**: Xolt is licensed under the MIT License.

### Example Code


```
NONE, WAIT :|
```

## Future Directions

### Independent Language Development

Xolt is envisioned as a standalone language with unique features and an ecosystem. However, the potential for creating a dependent version of Xolt, based on the XVM (Xolt Virtual Machine), is also being explored. This approach would allow for greater flexibility and compatibility with existing systems.

### XVM-Based Xolt

XVM, similar to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), is a virtual machine designed to run Xolt code. XVM-Based Xolt will leverage the existing XVM infrastructure, providing seamless integration with other XVM-compatible languages and tools.

### Key Benefits of XVM-Based Xolt

- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with other XVM-compatible languages and tools.
- **Scalability**: Built on a robust virtual machine, XVM-Based Xolt can scale to meet the demands of large-scale projects.
- **Community Support**: Although there is no community yet, development is being done by one person.

### Example Code in XVM-Based Xolt

```
NONE, WAIT :|
```

## Projected Timeline and Complexity

| Version          | Estimated Date       | Complexity (1-10) |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Xolt (XVM)       | ~12.12.2025           | 4/10              |
| Xolt (deXVMed)   | To Be Determined     | To Be Determined  |

## XVM Features

XVM will be initially developed because it is easier to create bytecode and a virtual machine for different operating systems than a compiler. More about the XVM concept can be read [here](/concepts/xvm/xvm.md).

## Language Concept in a Controlled Environment

Xolt is envisioned as a language that will be soft and flexible like Python but efficient in memory usage like C.

## Conclusion

Xolt is a concept that embodies simplicity, power, and versatility. Whether as a standalone language or a dependent version based on XVM, Xolt aims to provide developers with the tools to create solutions.
