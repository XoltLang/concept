# Xolt Language Concept

## Warning

>[!WARNING]
>This document is a concept and may be subject to change. The projected dates and development complexity may change. Do not expect a quick and exact implementation.

## A Bit of Background
Xolt is planned to be a compiled language, but at the moment, my resources are sufficient for an interpreted version of Xolt (also known as LazyXolt). For dates, please refer to the 'Approximate Dates' table.

## Concept
Xolt is a new language created, umm... as a form of import substitution in my country? Yes, although without any specific indication (This is RUSSIA, damn it! üòÜ, anything is possible here). Actually, I'm creating the language for fun, and it might be the first language for a new future programmer.

## Approximate Dates
| Version of Language | ETA          | Released? |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------|
| LazyXolt            | 25.12.2025?  | ‚ùå        |
| Xolt                | ???          | ‚ùÑÔ∏è        |

## Compatibility (Conceptual)
| Version of Language | Windows | MacOS | Linux | Android (WTF?) |
