# Thanks

We would like to express our gratitude to the following individuals, tools, and organizations for their contributions, inspiration, and support:

## Small Thanks:

- **Python**: In general, my first programming language that I started to learn.
- **Linux**: Gave me the concept that it's better to be a kind open-source enthusiast than a greedy corporation (though money wouldn't hurt :X). Although I use corporate tools, lol :D

## Medium Thanks:

- **Russian Government**: You know, RKN went to hell, and overall I laughed at the attempts of import substitution, so thanks for the high prices and inspiration.

## Ulyana Kuznetsova (❤️):

- The person I truly love, and she also gave me my first psychosis. I planned to name the language after her (check the concept of the language, not XVM), but then it went another way. Anyway, kiss ♡ (￣З￣). I hope she won't consider it de-anonymization or an insult (probably not, and sorry again, Ulya) :T

## Big Thanks:

- **Java**: For the idea of bytecode and JVM (in my case and language: XVM). Thanks to Sun Microsystems for the wonderful language, and I hope someone from them will read this someday (which is unlikely :), I pray for your hearts :D

Thank you all for your support and contributions!
