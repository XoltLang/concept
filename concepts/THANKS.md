# Thanks

We would like to express our gratitude to the following individuals, tools, and organizations for their contributions, inspiration, and support:

## Small Thanks:

- **Python**: In general, my first programming language that I started to learn.
- **Linux**: Gave me the concept that it's better to be a kind open-source enthusiast than a greedy corporation (though money wouldn't hurt :X). Although I use corporate tools, lol :D

## Medium Thanks:

- **Russian Government**: You know, RKN went to hell, and overall I laughed at the attempts of import substitution, so thanks for the high prices and inspiration.
